### Description
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:  

![](/picture/deletenodeinalinkedlist_1.png)  

### Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5  
Output: [4,1,9]  
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.  
### Example 2:  
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1  
Output: [4,5,9]  
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.  
### Note:  
The linked list will have at least two elements.  
All of the nodes' values will be unique.  
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.  
Do not return anything from your function.  

### Solution
这道题目让我们删除给定的链表节点，没有给定我们前置节点。将当前节点的值用下一个节点覆盖，并删除下一个节点即可。

#### Java解法
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```
